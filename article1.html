                <h3>3. Node.js vs Python: Scalability</h3>_________________________________________________________________________________<br>
                <cut></cut><br>
                It is obvious that you want many new people to use your applications without any hindrance. The capacity of an application to support an increasing number of users without any flaw in its performance is known as scalability.<br>
                <br>
                Scalability through Node.js programming can be achieved naturally as it creates asynchronous architecture in a single thread. This default feature of this Javascript framework ensures smooth scalability of application written in NodeJs code.<br>
                <br>
                Simple web apps can be created with a complete guarantee for scalability by using the NodeJS framework. If you wish to provide the same convenience in the complex app then you will have to hire Node.js app developers who have in-depth knowledge. <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, Python does not have the default feature for supporting asynchronous programming. This means that Python’s architecture is not as scalable as that of NodeJS. But Python has some tools to offer which allow achieving scalability easily.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Summary: NodeJS provides easy scalability as compared to Python.</b><br>
                _________________________________________________________________________________<br>
                <h3>4. Node.js vs Python: Learning Curve</h3>_________________________________________________________________________________<br>
                <br>
                The learning curve is a measurement of the ability of users to write code in a particular language or framework. It depicts the fluency of web app developers in syntax and tools. In the case of NodeJS, if you know JavaScript then it will not be a problem to learn this framework.<br>
                <br>
                This makes it easy to learn. Probably this is the reason the NodeJS has topped the list of most popular frameworks with a remarkable score of 49.9%.<br>
                <br>
                <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a26/2fd/cd0/a262fdcd04c481896a61851f9e6665eb.png" alt="image"><br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, Python language is not written in a well-known language like NodeJS. So, its syntax is new to the python developers. But it has a cleaner and compact code. One can easily write its code as they have to write fewer lines.<br>
                <br>
                A few lines of code in Python can help you reach the same result as NodeJS. Moreover, being an old language, it has well-developed documentation also. A software developer will never run short of knowledge base when it comes to Python.<br>
                <br>
                In the StackOverflow survey, Python is among the topmost preferred languages. Full-stack developers love to use this easy, precise, and efficient language for building apps. Here is the graphical representation of the same:<br>

                <br>
                Node.js is ideal for small projects in web application development and website development. It is not recommended for web development companies to use this framework of javascript for large projects because it lacks clear coding standards.<br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, Python is suitable for a vast range of projects from web apps, numerical computations, to machine learning and network programming. It is an ideal programming language to perform various tasks.<br>
                <br>
                Python has several frameworks that can be used for backend like, Django, Flask, Pyramids. It also has frameworks like Tkinter/PySide which can be used at the front-end. Its precise coding makes it ideal for large projects also.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore, if you are planning to get a large project developed then choose python developers. But if you have a small business or startup then your ideal choice should be to hire NodeJS web developers.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Summary: Node.js is suitable for small projects whereas python can be used for large projects also. Python can be used to do a variety of operations like machine learning etc.</b><br>
