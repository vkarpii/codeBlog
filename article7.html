            <p>Who doesn’t know about Java today? You can hear its mention in every nook and corner of the world. A significant majority of IT companies provide Java-based applications, while businesses are still driven to secure java applications due to robustness and stringent security facilities. However, Java frameworks are a matter of chaos for a variety of business owners that want their application to be standout. </p><br>
            <p>The fact is that there is no dearth of java frameworks that makes application development simple and efficient. However, a number of people have a query regarding the selection of java framework on the basis of features, ease-of-use, cost, and many more. Businesses hire programmers in India, though they stay confused on which platform they want their app to be created. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br>
            <p>While digital adoption is on the peak in the world, business owners &amp; software developers both are eager to know which framework is best for the development of their web application. Indeed, this dilemma is obvious in 2020 while there are hundreds of technologies and frameworks available to ease down application development hassle. </p><br>
            <p>Therefore, I and my developers at our <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/" rel="nofollow">software outsourcing company</a> have decided to jot out some Java frameworks that are very popular and you can pick one of them in 2020 for application development. So, here glean a complete insight about them. </p><br>
            <p><strong>Top 18 Java Frameworks In 2020<br>
            </strong><br>
            Presently, several Java frameworks are being used by developers. However, there are some that being used more frequently. In those, Spring is the apple of eyes and captures almost 30% of complete market usage. While others such as JSF, Struts, and GWT are struggling to beat each other. If you want to hire Java programmers, you need to have comprehensive understanding of frameworks to pick for development. Here are the usage statistics of some of the top java frameworks.</p><br>
            <p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gf/ji/vc/gfjivc2mqp01ndch-bmv6vs8wro.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
            Spring MVC<br>
            <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vr/ms/km/vrmskmxbxznrm8nuq7nkcyuf4-a.png" alt="image"><br>
            Spring is one of the most popular web Java frameworks. A majority of developers are using this platform today. Since its arrival in the market in 2002, this framework has captured almost complete Java development space. </p><br>
            <p>Among businesses and developers, it is a matter of attraction because of its property of being lightweight for application development. Here are some of the features that make it an incredible platform for web application development. </p><br>
            <p>POJO is a special aspect of this framework. Due to POJO implementation, there is no need to inherit or implement any interface while writing code. This makes this platform incredibly lightweight and simple.<br>
            Spring enables Aspect-Oriented programming allows cross-cutting such as logging and security and brings out the focused business logic. </p><br>
            <p>Spring is a complete container that enables designing and manages the lifecycle and configurations of the application. </p><br>
            <p>It also includes a robust transaction management API that provides the unification of all the transaction APIs. </p><br>
            <p>Another great feature is dependency injection which means it enables the development of loosely coupled applications. Thus, it is easy to perform unit testing of loosely coupled applications.<br>
            Moreover, it is easy to integrate this framework with others. </p><br>
            <p><strong>Spark<br>
            </strong><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/-x/nd/tt-xndc4ud5o-6qfa0olqgtmtzc.png" alt="image"></p><br>
            <p>Apache spark has grown exponentially in the market within very less time. It was released in 2014, and now it has become part of hundreds of applications development processes. Its lightning-fast speed and a robust in-memory data processing engine is the major aspect for the boosting of its popularity in the market. In the space of data analytics, it is very popular and greatly used. </p><br>
            <p>Spark provides a swift processing speed of almost 100x faster in memory and 10x faster on this. Its dynamic nature is also a major aspect that induces 80 high-level operators. It makes parallel application development easy. </p><br>
            <p>This Java framework allows the reuse of code for batch-processing, run ad-hoc queries on stream state and joining of the stream against historical data. </p><br>
            <p>Spark has stringent fault tolerance features named spark abstraction-RDD. It is specially designed to handle the failure of any working node in the cluster. </p><br>
            <p>This framework comes with dedicated tools for streamlining data, which makes it a perfect tool for data analysis. </p><br>
            <p><strong>Hibernate </strong><br>
            <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i_/rl/mg/i_rlmgwvmuf7on4slx9rtssrwwe.png" alt="image"><br>
            Hibernate is the second most popular platform Java web framework that makes Java web application development easy. This is a free, open-source object-relational mapping library, designed for making Java to map objects to RDBMS. Another purpose of its creation was to implement the object-oriented programming concepts in a relational database. </p><br>
            <p>Hibernate greatly support mapping both Object and Relational. While this also includes polymorphic, bi-directional association and association filtering. Moreover, it also offers XML mapping documents.<br>
            This framework introduces its own object-oriented query languages viz minimal object-oriented hibernate query language (HQL). </p><br>
            <p>There is no bytecode processing therefore it offers complete transparency.<br>
            Its most appreciated features include automatic Dirty checking, Detached object, tougher concept of composite keys and primary key auto-generation. </p><br>
            <p><strong>Struts </strong><br>

Currently, this is the third most used framework. It bears several incredible functionalities that make it a perfect tool for Java application development. </p><br>
            <p>Struts separate the presentation logic from business logic and make configuration centralized. It means the Struts_config.xml contains all information about your web application in an organized and concise way. </p><br>
            <p>Changing the application database is very easy as you need to change only action class.<br>
            Struts enables easy debugging and modifications for the code developed by the designer.<br>
            Moreover, struts has a simple user-interface that enables developers to create web applications in simple clicks and minimal coding. It is open-source, thus it is possible to create or add your own functions. </p><br>
